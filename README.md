# Vision-computing

This GitHub project brings together a series of computer vision mini projects covering various themes. Whether youâ€™re interested in biological imaging, medicine, industry, or simply more general topics from everyday life, youâ€™ll find concrete examples and solutions here.

Project Contents
1.	Biological Imaging:
â€¢	Cell Tracking: Monitoring cell movements and interactions from real-time images.
â€¢	Fluorescence Coupling: Using computer vision methods to analyze fluorescent images, such as detecting specific proteins within cells.

3.	Medical Applications:
â€¢	Blood Cell Detection: Automatic identification and counting of blood cells in samples.
â€¢	Cancer Cell Detection: Applying machine learning models to spot cancer cells in blood images.
â€¢	Histological Analysis: Identifying healthy or diseased structures in histological sections, such as tumor tissues or inflammatory regions.
â€¢	Dermatology: Classifying skin diseases based on dermatological images.
â€¢ Malaria detection.

5.	General Topics:
â€¢	Object Recognition: Detecting and classifying objects in everyday photos, e.g., cars, animals, etc.
â€¢	Person Detection: Tracking people in surveillance videos.
â€¢	Car Detection: Identifying vehicles in traffic images.

Objectives
â€¢	Provide code examples and tutorials for each mini project.
â€¢	Encourage collaboration and learning among computer vision enthusiasts.
â€¢	Explore new applications and areas of interest.
